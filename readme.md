hello.

this program expects you to type a number.

if the number is correct you'll be greated.

you have no source code.

but you have the disassembler and debugger!

you need to find the password. as already mentioned that's a number.

i am quite sure you can figure that out by disassembling this binary.

you also may want to debug it but i believe disassembling is enough.

have fun!

if you figured the password, create the file 'password' in the repo, write there the password and commit.

if you didn't - that's ok, just create some file and write there that you gave up, and commit.

you will get points for this lab anyway, if you just add some file and commit and push it to repo.

that's enough.
you'll just skip the fun.

till you didn't give up you have an opportunity to have fun.
